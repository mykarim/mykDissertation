	abstract = {We experimentally demonstrate that the flow rate of granular material through an aperture is controlled by the exit velocity imposed on the particles and not by the pressure at the base, contrary to what is often assumed in previous work. This result is achieved by studying the discharge process of a dense packing of monosized disks through an orifice. The flow is driven by a conveyor belt. This two-dimensional horizontal setup allows us to independently control the velocity at which the disks escape the horizontal silo and the pressure in the vicinity of the aperture. The flow rate is found to be proportional to the belt velocity, independent of the amount of disks in the container and, thus, independent of the pressure in the outlet region. In addition, this specific configuration makes it possible to get information on the system dynamics from a single image of the disks that rest on the conveyor belt after the discharge.},

From simple experiments with corn he inferred the saturation of pressure with height in a granular system. Subsequently, Janssen derived the equivalent of the barometric formula for granular material from the main assumption that the walls carry part of the weight. The following is a translation of this article. The wording is chosen as close as possible to the original. While drawings are copied from the original, figures displaying data are redone for better readability. The translation is complemented by some bibliographical notes and an assessment of earlier work, wherein Hagen predicted the saturation of pressure with depth in 1852, and Huber-Burnand demonstrated that saturation qualitatively as early as in 1829. We conclude with a brief discussion of more recent developments resting on Janssen's work.},

	abstract = {A wide variety of systems, including granular media, colloidal suspensions and molecular systems, exhibit non-equilibrium transitions from a fluid-like to a solid-like state, characterized solely by the sudden arrest of their dynamics. Crowding or jamming of the constituent particles traps them kinetically, precluding further exploration of the phase space. The disordered fluid-like structure remains essentially unchanged at the transition. The jammed solid can be refluidized by thermalization, through temperature or vibration, or by an applied stress. The generality of the jamming transition led to the proposal of a unifying description, based on a jamming phase diagram. It was further postulated that attractive interactions might have the same effect in jamming the system as a confining pressure, and thus could be incorporated into the generalized description. Here we study experimentally the fluid-to-solid transition of weakly attractive colloidal particles, which undergo markedly similar gelation behaviour with increasing concentration and decreasing thermalization or stress. Our results support the concept of a jamming phase diagram for attractive colloidal particles, providing a unifying link between the glass transition, gelation and aggregation.},

The majority of the tangential forces for particle-wall contacts are found to be close to the Coulomb failure criterion, in agreement with the theory of Janssen, while particle-particle contacts in the bulk are far from the Coulomb criterion. In addition, we show that a linear hydrostaticlike region at the top of the packings unexplained by the Janssen theory arises because most of the particle-wall tangential forces in this region are far from the Coulomb yield criterion. The distributions of particle-particle and particle-wall contact forces P(f) exhibit exponential-like decay at large forces in agreement with previous studies.},

	abstract = {Granular material freely discharging from a hopper under gravity is one of the oldest and most widely studied problems in granular flow. Despite the apparent simplicity of the system, expressions relating the discharge rate of the hopper to the properties of the individual grains are difficult to determine and typically empirical in nature. A mathematical model for discharge from a hopper is derived based on the dynamics of individual particles just within the outlet. In contrast to previous models, this analysis derives a flow rate from granular dynamics, rather than dimensional arguments. The model, therefore, uses no assumptions about the form of the stress distribution within the hopper, or the addition of empirical factors or fitting parameters. Our model gives a flow rate identical in form to a well-known empirical expression, showing that an experimentally determined constant used in this expression is purely geometry-dependent. Our analysis is also extended to derive an expression for the flow rate incorporating gas drag, which becomes dominant at small grain sizes, significantly reducing the outflow rate. The resulting expression shows excellent agreement with a range of computational simulations using a coupled discrete element and Navier-Stokes method. These simulations also show that the gas flow is much more complex than previously assumed in this region, and simplified assumptions used in prior hopper flow models do not hold.},

Modeling of mixing and segregation processes requires the confluence of several tools, including continuum and discrete descriptions (particle dynamics, Monte Carlo simulations, cellular automata computations) and, often, considerable geometrical insight. None of these viewpoints, however, is wholly satisfactory by itself. Moreover, continuum and discrete descriptions of granular flows are regime dependent, and this fact may require adopting different subviewpoints. This review organizes a body of knowledge that forms albeit imperfectly the beginnings of an expandable continuum framework for the description of mixing and segregation of granular materials. We focus primarily on noncohesive particles, possibly differing in size, density, shape, etc. We present segregation mechanisms and models for size and density segregation and introduce chaotic advection, which appears in noncircular tumblers. Chaotic advection interacts in nontrivial ways with segregation in granular materials and leads to unique equilibrium structures that serve as a prototype for systems displaying organization in the midst of disorder.},

Our experimental findings are interpreted here with the help of extensive, event driven Molecular Dynamics simulations. In addition to reproducing the experimental results, the simulations revealed that the current may be reversed as a function of the driving frequency as well.

In addition, we show, by changing the mass of the disks, that pressure can be changed while the flow rate remains constant. Conversely, we are able, by changing the belt velocity, to set different flow rates for the same pressure. The experiment confirms that, contrary to what has been implicitly assumed in numerous works, the flow rate through an aperture is not controlled by the pressure in the outlet region.},

The analysis of the system movement as a whole reveals that the observed bifurcation in the flight time is not adequately described by the Inelastic Bouncing Ball Model. Near the bifurcation point, friction plays an important role, and the branches of the bifurcation do not diverge as the control parameter is increased. By fitting the grains trajectories near the wall it is possible to quantify the effective acceleration acting on them. A comparison of the mass centre flying time and the flying time determined for the grains near the wall exposes the underlying mechanism that causes the downward flow.},

	abstract = {Recently, experiments showed that forces on intruders dragged horizontally through dense, hydrostatic granular packings mainly depend on the local surface orientation and can be seen as the sum of the forces exerted on small surface elements. In order to understand such forces more deeply, we perform a two-dimensional soft-sphere molecular dynamics simulation, on a similar setup, of an intruder dragged through a 50â50 bi-disperse granular packing, with diameters 0.30 and 0.34 cm. We measure, for both circular and half-circle shapes, the forces parallel (drag) and perpendicular (lift) to the drag direction as functions of the drag speed, with V=10.3â309 cm/s, and intruder depths, with D=3.75â37.5 cm. The drag forces on an intruder monotonically increase with V and D, and are larger for the circle. However, the lift force does not depend monotonically on V and D, and this relationship is affected by the shape of the intruder. The vertical force was negative for the half-circle, but for a small range of V and D, we measure positive lift. We find no sign change for the lift on the circle, which is always positive. The explanation for the nonmonotonic dependence is related to the decrease in contacts on the intruder as V increases. This is qualitatively similar to supersonic flow detachment from an obstacle. The detachment picture is supported by simulation measurements of the velocity field around the intruder and force profiles measured on its surface.},

The reason behind this disagreement is that the dilute flow assumption on which this argument is built breaks down as a granular shock wave forms in front of the obstacle.

In the regime where granular force dynamics are much more rapid than the intruder motion, we find that the particle flow near the intruder is proportional to the instantaneous intruder speed; it is essentially constant when normalized by that speed. The granular flow is nearly divergence free and remains in balance with the intruder, despite the latter's rapid deceleration. Simulations indicate that this observation is insensitive to grain properties, which can be explained by the separation of time scales between intergrain force dynamics and intruder dynamics. Assuming there is a comparable separation of time scales, we expect that our results are applicable to a broad class of dynamic or transient granular flows. Our results suggest that descriptions of static-in-time granular flows might be extended or modified to describe these dynamic flows. Additionally, we find that accurate grain-grain interactions are not necessary to correctly capture the granular flow in this regime.},

	abstract = {Velocity distributions in normal shock waves obtained in dilute granular flows are studied. These distributions cannot be described by a simple functional shape and are believed to be bimodal. Our results show that these distributions are not strictly bimodal but a trimodal distribution is shown to be sufficient. The usual Mott-Smith bimodal description of these distributions, developed for molecular gases, and based on the coexistence of two subpopulations (a supersonic and a subsonic population) in the shock front, can be modified by adding a third subpopulation. Our experiments show that this additional population results from collisions between the supersonic and subsonic subpopulations. We propose a simple approach incorporating the role of this third intermediate population to model the measured probability distributions and apply it to granular shocks as well as shocks in molecular gases.},

Simulation measurements of the drag force acting on the cylinder, F d , are expressed in terms of a dimensionless drag coefficient, C d =F d /[ 1 2 ÏÎ½ â U â 2 (D+d)], where Ï is the upstream particle mass density, Î½ â is the upstream solid fraction, U â is the upstream velocity, and (D+d) is the sum of the cylinder diameter, D, and surrounding particle diameter, d. The drag coefficient increases rapidly with decreasing Mach number for subsonic Mach numbers, but remains insensitive to Mach number for supersonic values. The drag coefficient is also a strong function of the flow Knudsen number, with the drag coefficient increasing with increasing Knudsen number and approaching an asymptotic value for very large Knudsen numbers. The drag coefficient decreases with decreasing normal coefficient of restitution and is relatively insensitive to the friction coefficient. Bow shock structures and expansion fans are also observed in the simulations and are compared to similar structures observed in compressible gas flows.},

Fluid. Mech. 22 (1990) 57, H.M. Jaeger, S.R. Nagel, R.P. Behringer, Phys. Today 494 (1996) 32]. Recently a difficult pattern was observed if sand falls in the space between two plates and passes an obstacle [Y. Amarouchene, J.F. Boudet, H. Kellay, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86 (2001) 4286]. The interesting behaviour occurs on top of the obstacle where a dynamic dune with a parabolic tip is formed. Inside this parabola, a triangular region of non- or very slow flowing sand is observed. Using factor analysis it is possible to extract latent parameters from a dynamic process. Applying a three factor model we can clearly identify the inner triangle (1st factor) and the outer parabolic pattern (3rd factor). The second factor we interpret as shock wave. Most interactions between particles take place in a relatively small region. We show that the pattern formation process depends on the restitution coefficients (particleâparticle and particleâobstacle) and also on the particle size. These findings cannot be observed if standard velocity profiles are used to analyse the data. Our findings show, that most interactions take place in a relatively small area correlating with the particle size. If the interactions between different particles and particleâobstacle are elastic the formation of a non-flowing triangular region is more difficult as if inelastic collisions are used. The factor curves also clearly show that a pattern formation process has to be finished, before the next pattern can be formed.},

The torque increases with the square of the effective immersion depth and the square of the effective vane diameter, and closely resembles the scaling behavior previously reported for the torque on rotating cylinders.

	abstract = {When an intruder strikes a granular material from above, the grains exert a stopping force which decelerates and stops the intruder. Many previous studies have used a macroscopic force law, including a drag force which is quadratic in velocity, to characterize the decelerating force on the intruder. However, the microscopic origins of the force-law terms are still a subject of debate. Here, drawing from previous experiments with photoelastic particles, we present a model which describes the velocity-squared force in terms of repeated collisions with clusters of grains. From our high speed photoelastic data, we infer that âclustersâ correspond to segments of the strong force network that are excited by the advancing intruder. The model predicts a scaling relation for the velocity-squared drag force that accounts for the intruder shape. Additionally, we show that the collisional model predicts an instability to rotations, which depends on the intruder shape. To test this model, we perform a comprehensive experimental study of the dynamics of two-dimensional granular impacts on beds of photoelastic disks, with different profiles for the leading edge of the intruder. We particularly focus on a simple and useful case for testing shape effects by using triangular-nosed intruders. We show that the collisional model effectively captures the dynamics of intruder deceleration and rotation; i.e., these two dynamical effects can be described as two different manifestations of the same grain-scale physical processes.},
