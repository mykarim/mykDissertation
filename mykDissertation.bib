  abstract={It has long been known that when a cable of specified length is hung between two poles, it takes the shape of a catenary—a hyperbolic cosine function. In this paper, we study a variation of this problem. First, we consider a cable hanging between two poles in which one end of the cable is fixed to one pole; the other end of the cable runs over a pulley, attached to the other pole, and then down to a table. Here, the length of the cable can vary as the pulley rotates. For a specified horizontal distance between the two poles, we vary the height of the fixed cable end. We then determine both experimentally and analytically the stability of the resulting catenary-cable shapes. Interestingly, at certain heights there are two catenaries of different lengths—we use Newtonian mechanics to show that only one of these is stable. Below a certain critical height, no catenary exists and the cable is pulled down to the table. Finally, we explore a related problem in which one end of the cable runs over a pulley, but the other end can now freely move vertically along a pole. These experiments nicely lend themselves as teaching tools in a classroom setting.}

They form a flat disk, as the result of an interplay of angular momentum conservation and the steady loss of energy in dissipative interparticle collisions.

It has been suggested that this size distribution may arise from a balance between aggregation and fragmentation of ring particles, yet neither the power-law dependence nor the upper size cutoff have been established on theoretical grounds. Here we propose a model for the particle size distribution that quantitatively explains the observations. In accordance with data, our model predicts the exponent q to be constrained to the interval 2.75≤q≤3.52.75≤q≤3.5{\textless}mml:math{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mn{\textgreater}2.75{\textless}/mml:mn{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mo{\textgreater}≤{\textless}/mml:mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi{\textgreater}q{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mo{\textgreater}≤{\textless}/mml:mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mn{\textgreater}3.5{\textless}/mml:mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:math{\textgreater}. Also an exponential cutoff for larger particle sizes establishes naturally with the cutoff radius being set by the relative frequency of aggregating and disruptive collisions. This cutoff is much smaller than the typical scale of microstructures seen in Saturn’s rings.},

	abstract = {We experimentally demonstrate that the flow rate of granular material through an aperture is controlled by the exit velocity imposed on the particles and not by the pressure at the base, contrary to what is often assumed in previous work. This result is achieved by studying the discharge process of a dense packing of monosized disks through an orifice. The flow is driven by a conveyor belt. This two-dimensional horizontal setup allows us to independently control the velocity at which the disks escape the horizontal silo and the pressure in the vicinity of the aperture. The flow rate is found to be proportional to the belt velocity, independent of the amount of disks in the container and, thus, independent of the pressure in the outlet region. In addition, this specific configuration makes it possible to get information on the system dynamics from a single image of the disks that rest on the conveyor belt after the discharge.},

From simple experiments with corn he inferred the saturation of pressure with height in a granular system. Subsequently, Janssen derived the equivalent of the barometric formula for granular material from the main assumption that the walls carry part of the weight. The following is a translation of this article. The wording is chosen as close as possible to the original. While drawings are copied from the original, figures displaying data are redone for better readability. The translation is complemented by some bibliographical notes and an assessment of earlier work, wherein Hagen predicted the saturation of pressure with depth in 1852, and Huber-Burnand demonstrated that saturation qualitatively as early as in 1829. We conclude with a brief discussion of more recent developments resting on Janssen's work.},

	abstract = {A wide variety of systems, including granular media, colloidal suspensions and molecular systems, exhibit non-equilibrium transitions from a fluid-like to a solid-like state, characterized solely by the sudden arrest of their dynamics. Crowding or jamming of the constituent particles traps them kinetically, precluding further exploration of the phase space. The disordered fluid-like structure remains essentially unchanged at the transition. The jammed solid can be refluidized by thermalization, through temperature or vibration, or by an applied stress. The generality of the jamming transition led to the proposal of a unifying description, based on a jamming phase diagram. It was further postulated that attractive interactions might have the same effect in jamming the system as a confining pressure, and thus could be incorporated into the generalized description. Here we study experimentally the fluid-to-solid transition of weakly attractive colloidal particles, which undergo markedly similar gelation behaviour with increasing concentration and decreasing thermalization or stress. Our results support the concept of a jamming phase diagram for attractive colloidal particles, providing a unifying link between the glass transition, gelation and aggregation.},

The majority of the tangential forces for particle-wall contacts are found to be close to the Coulomb failure criterion, in agreement with the theory of Janssen, while particle-particle contacts in the bulk are far from the Coulomb criterion. In addition, we show that a linear hydrostaticlike region at the top of the packings unexplained by the Janssen theory arises because most of the particle-wall tangential forces in this region are far from the Coulomb yield criterion. The distributions of particle-particle and particle-wall contact forces P(f) exhibit exponential-like decay at large forces in agreement with previous studies.},

	abstract = {Granular material freely discharging from a hopper under gravity is one of the oldest and most widely studied problems in granular flow. Despite the apparent simplicity of the system, expressions relating the discharge rate of the hopper to the properties of the individual grains are difficult to determine and typically empirical in nature. A mathematical model for discharge from a hopper is derived based on the dynamics of individual particles just within the outlet. In contrast to previous models, this analysis derives a flow rate from granular dynamics, rather than dimensional arguments. The model, therefore, uses no assumptions about the form of the stress distribution within the hopper, or the addition of empirical factors or fitting parameters. Our model gives a flow rate identical in form to a well-known empirical expression, showing that an experimentally determined constant used in this expression is purely geometry-dependent. Our analysis is also extended to derive an expression for the flow rate incorporating gas drag, which becomes dominant at small grain sizes, significantly reducing the outflow rate. The resulting expression shows excellent agreement with a range of computational simulations using a coupled discrete element and Navier-Stokes method. These simulations also show that the gas flow is much more complex than previously assumed in this region, and simplified assumptions used in prior hopper flow models do not hold.},

	abstract = {Granular materials segregate. Small differences in either size or density lead to flow-induced segregation, a complex phenomenon without parallel in fluids. Modeling of mixing and segregation processes requires the confluence of several tools, including continuum and discrete descriptions (particle dynamics, Monte Carlo simulations, cellular automata computations) and, often, considerable geometrical insight. None of these viewpoints, however, is wholly satisfactory by itself. Moreover, continuum and discrete descriptions of granular flows are regime dependent, and this fact may require adopting different subviewpoints. This review organizes a body of knowledge that forms albeit imperfectly the beginnings of an expandable continuum framework for the description of mixing and segregation of granular materials. We focus primarily on noncohesive particles, possibly differing in size, density, shape, etc. We present segregation mechanisms and models for size and density segregation and introduce chaotic advection, which appears in noncircular tumblers. Chaotic advection interacts in nontrivial ways with segregation in granular materials and leads to unique equilibrium structures that serve as a prototype for systems displaying organization in the midst of disorder.},

The resulting material flow exhibits novel collective behavior, both as a function of the number of layers of particles and the driving frequency; in particular, under certain conditions, increasing the layer thickness leads to a reversal of the current, while the onset of transport as a function of frequency occurs gradually in a manner reminiscent of a phase transition. Our experimental findings are interpreted here with the help of extensive, event driven Molecular Dynamics simulations. In addition to reproducing the experimental results, the simulations revealed that the current may be reversed as a function of the driving frequency as well. We also give details about the simulations so that similar numerical studies can be carried out in a more straightforward manner in the future.},

The analysis of the system movement as a whole reveals that the observed bifurcation in the flight time is not adequately described by the Inelastic Bouncing Ball Model. Near the bifurcation point, friction plays an important role, and the branches of the bifurcation do not diverge as the control parameter is increased. By fitting the grains trajectories near the wall it is possible to quantify the effective acceleration acting on them. A comparison of the mass centre flying time and the flying time determined for the grains near the wall exposes the underlying mechanism that causes the downward flow.},

	abstract = {Recently, experiments showed that forces on intruders dragged horizontally through dense, hydrostatic granular packings mainly depend on the local surface orientation and can be seen as the sum of the forces exerted on small surface elements. In order to understand such forces more deeply, we perform a two-dimensional soft-sphere molecular dynamics simulation, on a similar setup, of an intruder dragged through a 50–50 bi-disperse granular packing, with diameters 0.30 and 0.34 cm. We measure, for both circular and half-circle shapes, the forces parallel (drag) and perpendicular (lift) to the drag direction as functions of the drag speed, with V=10.3–309 cm/s, and intruder depths, with D=3.75–37.5 cm. The drag forces on an intruder monotonically increase with V and D, and are larger for the circle. However, the lift force does not depend monotonically on V and D, and this relationship is affected by the shape of the intruder. The vertical force was negative for the half-circle, but for a small range of V and D, we measure positive lift. We find no sign change for the lift on the circle, which is always positive. The explanation for the nonmonotonic dependence is related to the decrease in contacts on the intruder as V increases. This is qualitatively similar to supersonic flow detachment from an obstacle. The detachment picture is supported by simulation measurements of the velocity field around the intruder and force profiles measured on its surface.},

The theoretical argument, based on the force exerted on the obstacle due to inelastic, frictionless collisions of a very dilute flow, captures the qualitative features of the lift, but fails to reproduce the data quantitatively. The reason behind this disagreement is that the dilute flow assumption on which this argument is built breaks down as a granular shock wave forms in front of the obstacle. More specifically, the shock wave changes the grains impact velocity at the obstacle, decreasing the overall net lift obtained from a very dilute flow.},

	abstract = {We study experimentally and computationally the dynamics of granular flow during impacts where intruders strike a collection of disks from above. In the regime where granular force dynamics are much more rapid than the intruder motion, we find that the particle flow near the intruder is proportional to the instantaneous intruder speed; it is essentially constant when normalized by that speed. The granular flow is nearly divergence free and remains in balance with the intruder, despite the latter's rapid deceleration. Simulations indicate that this observation is insensitive to grain properties, which can be explained by the separation of time scales between intergrain force dynamics and intruder dynamics. Assuming there is a comparable separation of time scales, we expect that our results are applicable to a broad class of dynamic or transient granular flows. Our results suggest that descriptions of static-in-time granular flows might be extended or modified to describe these dynamic flows. Additionally, we find that accurate grain-grain interactions are not necessary to correctly capture the granular flow in this regime.},

The resulting model is calibrated against a sequence of existing discrete element method data sets for two-dimensional annular shear, where it is shown that the model correctly describes the divergence from a local rheology due to the grain size as well as the rate-independence phenomenon commonly observed in slowly flowing zones. The same law is then applied in two additional inhomogeneous flow geometries, and the predicted velocity profiles are compared against corresponding discrete element method simulations utilizing the same grain composition as before, yielding favorable agreement in each case.},

The usual Mott-Smith bimodal description of these distributions, developed for molecular gases, and based on the coexistence of two subpopulations (a supersonic and a subsonic population) in the shock front, can be modified by adding a third subpopulation. Our experiments show that this additional population results from collisions between the supersonic and subsonic subpopulations.

The drag coefficient increases rapidly with decreasing Mach number for subsonic Mach numbers, but remains insensitive to Mach number for supersonic values. The drag coefficient is also a strong function of the flow Knudsen number, with the drag coefficient increasing with increasing Knudsen number and approaching an asymptotic value for very large Knudsen numbers. The drag coefficient decreases with decreasing normal coefficient of restitution and is relatively insensitive to the friction coefficient.

Fluid. Mech. 22 (1990) 57, H.M. Jaeger, S.R. Nagel, R.P. Behringer, Phys. Today 494 (1996) 32]. Recently a difficult pattern was observed if sand falls in the space between two plates and passes an obstacle [Y. Amarouchene, J.F. Boudet, H. Kellay, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86 (2001) 4286]. The interesting behaviour occurs on top of the obstacle where a dynamic dune with a parabolic tip is formed. Inside this parabola, a triangular region of non- or very slow flowing sand is observed. Using factor analysis it is possible to extract latent parameters from a dynamic process. Applying a three factor model we can clearly identify the inner triangle (1st factor) and the outer parabolic pattern (3rd factor). The second factor we interpret as shock wave. Most interactions between particles take place in a relatively small region. We show that the pattern formation process depends on the restitution coefficients (particle–particle and particle–obstacle) and also on the particle size. These findings cannot be observed if standard velocity profiles are used to analyse the data. Our findings show, that most interactions take place in a relatively small area correlating with the particle size. If the interactions between different particles and particle–obstacle are elastic the formation of a non-flowing triangular region is more difficult as if inelastic collisions are used. The factor curves also clearly show that a pattern formation process has to be finished, before the next pattern can be formed.},

	abstract = {When an intruder strikes a granular material from above, the grains exert a stopping force which decelerates and stops the intruder. Many previous studies have used a macroscopic force law, including a drag force which is quadratic in velocity, to characterize the decelerating force on the intruder. However, the microscopic origins of the force-law terms are still a subject of debate. Here, drawing from previous experiments with photoelastic particles, we present a model which describes the velocity-squared force in terms of repeated collisions with clusters of grains. From our high speed photoelastic data, we infer that “clusters” correspond to segments of the strong force network that are excited by the advancing intruder. The model predicts a scaling relation for the velocity-squared drag force that accounts for the intruder shape. Additionally, we show that the collisional model predicts an instability to rotations, which depends on the intruder shape. To test this model, we perform a comprehensive experimental study of the dynamics of two-dimensional granular impacts on beds of photoelastic disks, with different profiles for the leading edge of the intruder. We particularly focus on a simple and useful case for testing shape effects by using triangular-nosed intruders. We show that the collisional model effectively captures the dynamics of intruder deceleration and rotation; i.e., these two dynamical effects can be described as two different manifestations of the same grain-scale physical processes.},

This constraint takes the form a bound between the distribution of contact forces P(f) and the pair distribution function g(r): if P(f) {\textbackslash}sim f{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}theta\} and g(r) {\textbackslash}sim (r-\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}){\textasciicircum}(-\{{\textbackslash}gamma\}), where \{{\textbackslash}sigma\} is the particle diameter, one finds that \{{\textbackslash}gamma\} {\textbackslash}geq 1/(2+\{{\textbackslash}theta\}). This bound plays a role similar to those found in some glassy materials with long-range interactions, such as the Coulomb gap in Anderson insulators or the distribution of local fields in mean-field spin glasses. There is ground to believe that this bound is saturated, offering an explanation for the presence of avalanches of rearrangements with power-law statistics observed in packings.},

Understanding such forces and their spatial correlations, specifically in response to forces at the system boundaries, represents a fundamental goal of granular mechanics. The problem is of relevance to civil engineering, geophysics and physics, being important for the understanding of jamming, shear-induced yielding and mechanical response. Here we report measurements of the normal and tangential grain-scale forces inside a two-dimensional system of photoelastic disks that are subject to pure shear and isotropic compression. Various statistical measures show the underlying differences between these two stress states. These differences appear in the distributions of normal forces (which are more rounded for compression than shear), although not in the distributions of tangential forces (which are exponential in both cases). Sheared systems show anisotropy in the distributions of both the contact network and the contact forces. Anisotropy also occurs in the spatial correlations of forces, which provide a quantitative replacement for the idea of force chains. Sheared systems have long-range correlations in the direction of force chains, whereas isotropically compressed systems have short-range correlations regardless of the direction.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0370-1573(97)00069-0},
	abstract = {Amorphous solids fall into any reasonable definition of a solid. This means that it should be possible to describe amorphous solids in terms of an expansion in deviations from a well defined rigid microscopic reference frame — as in the Cauchy-Born lattice-dynamics of periodic crystals. The continuum limit of this microscopic expansion is a field theory — continuum elasticity. It follows that different types of amorphous solids can differ from each other and from crystalline solids only because of differences in the nature of their microscopic reference states. A theory of amorphous solids which implements this general point of view must satisfy two very general restrictions: (1) translation-rotation invariance of the expansion and (2) the reference state must be a stable equilibrium state. We construct such a general theory and also describe some results of its application to specific types of amorphous solids. The monograph consists of three parts.

Part I. The Cauchy-Born Theory of Solids, describes a general and explicitly translation-rotation invariant formulation of the Cauchy-Born expansion. This is done by using the fact that the translation-rotation invariant energy of a many particle system can be regarded as a function of the interparticle distances. The resulting formalism leads to local expressions for the continuum limit which can be used to derive microscopic expressions for the local elastic constants and for the stresses from the coefficients in the microscopic expansion around a specific reference state. One finds that the initial stresses in the microscopic reference state lead to special stress induced terms in the harmonic expansion whose continuum limit is the second order strain. Their effect on the bulk stability of the reference states of tenuous solids is closely analogous to the role of stresses in continuum stability theory.

Part II. The Rigidity of Floppy Bonded Networks, studies the stability of tenuous reference states. The theory developed in this section extends the standard considerations of the effect of stresses on the elastic stability of thin rods and shells to the complex internal structures which describe the bulk of solids. There is a geometric aspect. The interaction scheme of a physical model, the bond structure, defines a graph — the bonded network. When this network can be deformed continuously in d-dimensions even when all its bonded distances are fixed is geometrically floppy. A model which is described by such a network has a manifold of free degrees of freedom which have no rigidity for unstressed reference states. Mostly the free modes describe collective deformations of the reference state. We show that their number can be very large and that they often constitute a significant fraction of all eigenmodes. Like the bending of a thin rod these free modes are sensitive to stresses in the reference state around which one is expanding. When there are stresses they can become unstable, leading to structural buckling instabilities, or stable — depending on the sign of the relevant stresses. The theory of floppy networks thus allows us to study structural buckling, the bulk analog of the Euler buckling of rods and shells, and the stabilization of bulk shears by stretching which is the origin of the shear rigidity of most soft solids.

Part III. The Role of Stresses in Amorphous Solids, applies these results. The emphasis is on the stability of the reference state. We require stability against structural buckling and on the role of stresses in stabilizing the soft modes of tenuous bonding structures. The shear rigidity of rubbers and wet gel-likes is that of floppy bonded networks which are stretched. Like the shear rigidity of stretched membranes it is that of a network of stretched springs. We show that this is possible only because such solids are not rigid down to the atomic level. We discuss the stability of stressed granular packings emphasizing the fact that the packing has to be stable against structural buckling. This gives considerable insight into the internal mechanics of granular packings because it not only considers the equilibrium conditions on the individual grains but also the collective linear stability of a stressed packing. We then describe a new model of quenched glasses which emphasizes the role of the internal stresses in the glass. The essence of this model is the distinction between the molecular configuration in the quenched liquid, the “snapshot state” and the stable equilibrium reference state of the glass which emerges from it even for the most rapid ideal quench. We argue that structural buckling dominates the restructuring in the ideal quench and show that this predicts strong correlations between the local structure of the reference state and the internal stresses. Some of the most striking properties of glasses appear naturally in this microscopic model.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of finite-size effects in jammed packings of N soft, frictionless spheres at zero temperature. There is a 1/N correction to the discrete jump in the contact number at the transition so that jammed packings exist only above isostaticity. As a result, the canonical power-law scalings of the contact number and elastic moduli break down at low pressure. These quantities exhibit scaling collapse with a non-trivial scaling function, demonstrating that the jamming transition can be considered a phase transition. Scaling is achieved as a function of N in both 2 and 3 dimensions, indicating an upper critical dimension of 2.},

	abstract = {The isotropic algorithm is constructed for random close packing of equisized spheres with triply periodic boundary conditions. All previously published packing methods with periodic boundaries were kinetics-determined; i.e., they contained a densification rate as an arbitrary parameter. In contrast, the present algorithm is kinetic-independent and demonstrates an unambiguous convergence to the experimental results. To suppress crystallization, the main principles of our algorithm are (1) to form a contact network at an early stage and (2) retain contacts throughout the densification, as far as possible. The particles are allowed to swell by the numerical solution of the differential equations of densification. The RHS of these equations is calculated efficiently from a linear system by a combination of conjugate gradient iterations and exact sparse matrix technology. When an excessive contact occurs and one of the existing bonds should be broken to continue the densification, an efficient criterion based on multidimensional simplex geometry is used for searching the separating bond. The algorithm has a well-defined termination point resulting in a perfect contact network with the average coordination number six (for particle number N\&gt;1) and a system of normal reactions between the spheres maintaining the structure. These forces are the counterpart of the algorithm and can be used to calculate small elastic particle deformations in a granular medium. Extensive calculations are presented for 50 ≤ N 5 400 and demonstrate very good agreement with the experimental packing density (about 0.637 ) and structure.},

These size-topology relations can be described by a simple analytical theory, which quantifies the effects of positional disorder in the monodisperse case and those of size disorder in the polydisperse case and is applicable in two and three dimensions. The theory thus gives a unifying framework for a wide range of amorphous systems, ranging from biological tissues, foams, and bidisperse disks to compressed emulsions and granular matter.},

In particular, given a set of n spheres in dimension d, we show that the worst case complexity of both a single additively weighted Voronoi cell and the convex hull of the set of spheres is Θ(n[d/2]).

	abstract = {Dense random packings of hard particles are useful models of granular media and are closely related to the structure of nonequilibrium low-temperature amorphous phases of matter. Most work has been done for random jammed packings of spheres and it is only recently that corresponding packings of nonspherical particles (e.g., ellipsoids) have received attention. Here we report a study of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) packings of binary superdisks and monodispersed superballs whose shapes are defined by {\textbar}x1{\textbar}2p+⋯+{\textbar}xd{\textbar}2p≤1 with d=2 and 3, respectively, where p is the deformation parameter with values in the interval (0,∞). As p increases from zero, one can get a family of both concave (0{\textless}p{\textless}0.5) and convex (p≥0.5) particles with square symmetry (d=2), or octahedral and cubic symmetry (d=3). In particular, for p=1 the particle is a perfect sphere (circular disk) and for p→∞ the particle is a perfect cube (square). We find that the MRJ densities of such packings increase dramatically and nonanalytically as one moves away from the circular-disk and sphere point (p=1). Moreover, the disordered packings are hypostatic, i.e., the average number of contacting neighbors is less than twice the total number of degrees of freedom per particle, and yet the packings are mechanically stable. As a result, the local arrangements of particles are necessarily nontrivially correlated to achieve jamming. We term such correlated structures “nongeneric.” The degree of “nongenericity” of the packings is quantitatively characterized by determining the fraction of local coordination structures in which the central particles have fewer contacting neighbors than average. We also show that such seemingly “special” packing configurations are counterintuitively not rare. As the anisotropy of the particles increases, the fraction of rattlers decreases while the minimal orientational order as measured by the tetratic and cubatic order parameters increases. These characteristics result from the unique manner in which superballs break their rotational symmetry, which also makes the superdisk and superball packings distinctly different from other known nonspherical hard-particle packings.},

On the high-r side of this peak, g(r) decays as a power law. In the split second peak, the two subpeaks are both singular at the transition, with power-law behavior on their low-r sides and step-function drop-offs on their high-r sides.

Apart from its mathematical interest, the problem has practical relevance in a wide range of fields, from granular processing to fruit packing. There are currently numerous experiments showing that the loosest way to pack spheres (random loose packing) gives a density of 55 per cent. On the other hand, the most compact way to pack spheres (random close packing) results in a maximum density of 64 per cent. Although these values seem to be robust, there is as yet no physical interpretation for them. Here we present a statistical description of jammed states in which random close packing can be interpreted as the ground state of the ensemble of jammed matter. Our approach demonstrates that random packings of hard spheres in three dimensions cannot exceed a density limit of 63.4 per cent. We construct a phase diagram that provides a unified view of the hard-sphere packing problem and illuminates various data, including the random-loose-packed state.},

However, because thermal motion becomes relevant when the particles are small enough, it is imperative to understand how these length scales evolve as the temperature is increased. Here we used both colloidal experiments and computer simulations to progress beyond the zero-temperature limit to track one of the key parameters—the overlap distance between neighbouring particles—which vanishes at the T = 0 jamming transition. We find that this structural feature retains a vestige of its T = 0 behaviour and evolves in an unusual manner, which has masked its appearance until now. It is evident as a function of packing fraction at fixed temperature, but not as a function of temperature at fixed packing fraction or pressure. Our results conclusively demonstrate that length scales associated with the T = 0 jamming transition persist in thermal systems, not only in simulations but also in laboratory experiments.},

	abstract = {Sphere packings in high dimensions have been the subject of recent theoretical interest. Employing numerical and theoretical methods, we investigate the structural characteristics of random sequential addition (RSA) of congruent spheres in d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd in the infinite-time or saturation limit for the first six space dimensions (1≤d≤6). Specifically, we determine the saturation density, pair correlation function, cumulative coordination number and the structure factor in each of these dimensions. We find that for 2≤d≤6, the saturation density ϕs scales with dimension as ϕs=c1∕2d+c2d∕2d, where c1=0.202 048 and c2=0.973 872. We also show analytically that the same density scaling is expected to persist in the high-dimensional limit, albeit with different coefficients. A byproduct of this high-dimensional analysis is a relatively sharp lower bound on the saturation density for any d given by ϕs≥(d+2)(1−S0)∕2d+1, where S0∊[0,1] is the structure factor at k=0 (i.e., infinite-wavelength number variance) in the high-dimensional limit. We demonstrate that a Palàsti-type conjecture (the saturation density in Rd is equal to that of the one-dimensional problem raised to the dth power) cannot be true for RSA hyperspheres. We show that the structure factor S(k) must be analytic at k=0 and that RSA packings for 1≤d≤6 are nearly “hyperuniform.” Consistent with the recent “decorrelation principle,” we find that pair correlations markedly diminish as the space dimension increases up to six. We also obtain kissing (contact) number statistics for saturated RSA configurations on the surface of a d-dimensional sphere for dimensions 2≤d≤5 and compare to the maximal kissing numbers in these dimensions. We determine the structure factor exactly for the related “ghost” RSA packing in Rd and demonstrate that its distance from “hyperuniformity” increases as the space dimension increases, approaching a constant asymptotic value of 1∕2. Our work has implications for the possible existence of disordered classical ground states for some continuous potentials in sufficiently high dimensions.},

As the shear stress is increased, a static, rigid material can start to yield and flow as it becomes unjammed. The time- and ensemble-averaged distribution of forces shows a marked change in character at this jamming-unjamming transition. Here, we investigate the temporal fluctuations of the forces between individual particles and the external boundary in a dense, slowly sheared system. We find that the fluctuations occur over a very broad range of time scales, resulting in power spectra characterized by a 1/f-type shape and a rollover to 1/f2 behavior above a turnover frequency f∗. At very low frequencies additional enhancements over the 1/f contributions are observed in regions of significant in-plane shear. Moreover, the magnitude of the force fluctuation spectra produced by one particle is different from those produced by its neighbors. Such heterogeneities persist over periods of time exceeding our measurement interval (60 h). In this respect they are reminiscent of the dynamic heterogeneities that occur in liquids supercooled toward the glass transition temperature.},

On the basis of these results, we conclude that restoration of more subtle features to the test-function family of g's (i.e., a split second peak, and a jump discontinuity at twice the collision diameter) will remove these unusual characteristics, while presumably increasing the maximum density slightly. A byproduct of our investigation is a lower bound on the maximum density for random sphere packings in d dimensions, which is sharper than a well-known lower bound for regular lattice packings for d ≥ 3.

Solutions to the DLP problem are relevant to the realizability of pair correlation functions for packings of nonoverlapping spheres and might prove useful in improving upon the best known upper bounds on the maximum packing fraction of sphere packings in dimensions greater than 3. The optimal spherical code problem in d involves the placement of the centers of N nonoverlapping spheres of unit diameter onto the surface of a sphere of radius R such that R is minimized. It is proved that in any dimension, all solutions between unity and the golden ratio τ to the optimal spherical code problem for N spheres are also solutions to the corresponding DLP problem.

No periodic lattice is consistent with either, and hence these dense packings are geometrically frustrated. Because icosahedra can be assembled from almost perfect tetrahedra, the terms “icosahedral” and “polytetrahedral” packing are often used interchangeably, which leaves the true origin of geometric frustration unclear. Here we report a computational study of freezing of 4D Euclidean hard spheres, where the densest Voronoi cluster is compatible with the symmetry of the densest crystal, while polytetrahedral order is not. We observe that, under otherwise comparable conditions, crystal nucleation in four dimensions is less facile than in three dimensions, which is consistent with earlier observations [ M. Skoge et al.

	abstract = {We study the approach to jamming in hard-sphere packings and, in particular, the pair correlation function g2(r) around contact, both theoretically and computationally. Our computational data unambiguously separate the narrowing δ-function contribution to g2 due to emerging interparticle contacts from the background contribution due to near contacts. The data also show with unprecedented accuracy that disordered hard-sphere packings are strictly isostatic: i.e., the number of exact contacts in the jamming limit is exactly equal to the number of degrees of freedom, once rattlers are removed. For such isostatic packings, we derive a theoretical connection between the probability distribution of interparticle forces Pf(f), which we measure computationally, and the contact contribution to g2. We verify this relation for computationally generated isostatic packings that are representative of the maximally random jammed state. We clearly observe a maximum in Pf and a nonzero probability of zero force, shedding light on long-standing questions in the granular-media literature. We computationally observe an unusual power-law divergence in the near-contact contribution to g2, persistent even in the jamming limit, with exponent −0.4 clearly distinguishable from previously proposed inverse-square-root divergence. Additionally, we present high-quality numerical data on the two discontinuities in the split-second peak of g2 and use a shared-neighbor analysis of the graph representing the contact network to study the local particle clusters responsible for the peculiar features. Finally, we present the computational data on the contact contribution to g2 for vacancy-diluted fcc crystal packings and also investigate partially crystallized packings along the transition from maximally disordered to fully ordered packings. We find that the contact network remains isostatic even when ordering is present. Unlike previous studies, we find that ordering has a significant impact on the shape of Pf for small forces.},

	abstract = {We introduce a generalization of the well-known random sequential addition (RSA) process for hard spheres in d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd. We show that all of the n-particle correlation functions of this nonequilibrium model, in a certain limit called the “ghost” RSA packing, can be obtained analytically for all allowable densities and in any dimension. This represents the first exactly solvable disordered sphere-packing model in an arbitrary dimension. The fact that the maximal density ϕ(∞)=1∕2d of the ghost RSA packing implies that there may be disordered sphere packings in sufficiently high d whose density exceeds Minkowski’s lower bound for Bravais lattices, the dominant asymptotic term of which is 1∕2d. Indeed, we report on a conjectural lower bound on the density whose asymptotic behavior is controlled by 2−(0.778 65…)d, thus providing the putative exponential improvement on Minkowski’s 100-year-old bound. Our results suggest that the densest packings in sufficiently high dimensions may be disordered rather than periodic, implying the existence of disordered classical ground states for some continuous potentials.},

	abstract = {We present a study of disordered jammed hard-sphere packings in four-, five-, and six-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Using a collision-driven packing generation algorithm, we obtain the first estimates for the packing fractions of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) states for space dimensions d=4, 5, and 6 to be ϕMRJ≈0.46, 0.31, and 0.20, respectively. To a good approximation, the MRJ density obeys the scaling form ϕMRJ=c1∕2d+(c2d)∕2d, where c1=−2.72 and c2=2.56, which appears to be consistent with the high-dimensional asymptotic limit, albeit with different coefficients. Calculations of the pair correlation function g2(r) and structure factor S(k) for these states show that short-range ordering appreciably decreases with increasing dimension, consistent with a recently proposed “decorrelation principle,” which, among other things, states that unconstrained correlations diminish as the dimension increases and vanish entirely in the limit d→∞. As in three dimensions (where ϕMRJ≈0.64), the packings show no signs of crystallization, are isostatic, and have a power-law divergence in g2(r) at contact with power-law exponent ≈0.4. Across dimensions, the cumulative number of neighbors equals the kissing number of the conjectured densest packing close to where g2(r) has its first minimum. Additionally, we obtain estimates for the freezing and melting packing fractions for the equilibrium hard-sphere fluid-solid transition, ϕF≈0.32 and ϕM≈0.39, respectively, for d=4, and ϕF≈0.20 and ϕM≈0.25, respectively, for d=5.

	abstract = {We have studied how two- and three-dimensional systems made up of particles interacting with finite range, repulsive potentials jam (i.e., develop a yield stress in a disordered state) at zero temperature and zero applied stress. At low packing fractions φ, the system is not jammed and each particle can move without impediment from its neighbors. For each configuration, there is a unique jamming threshold φc at which particles can no longer avoid each other, and the bulk and shear moduli simultaneously become nonzero. The distribution of φc values becomes narrower as the system size increases, so that essentially all configurations jam at the same packing fraction in the thermodynamic limit. This packing fraction corresponds to the previously measured value for random close packing. In fact, our results provide a well-defined meaning for “random close packing” in terms of the fraction of all phase space with inherent structures that jam. The jamming threshold, point J, occurring at zero temperature and applied stress and at the random-close-packing density, has properties reminiscent of an ordinary critical point. As point J is approached from higher packing fractions, power-law scaling is found for the divergence of the first peak in the pair correlation function and in the vanishing of the pressure, shear modulus, and excess number of overlapping neighbors. Moreover, near point J, certain quantities no longer self-average, suggesting the existence of a length scale that diverges at J. However, point J also differs from an ordinary critical point: the scaling exponents do not depend on dimension but do depend on the interparticle potential. Finally, as point J is approached from high packing fractions, the density of vibrational states develops a large excess of low-frequency modes. Indeed, at point J, the density of states is a constant all the way down to zero frequency. All of these results suggest that point J is a point of maximal disorder and may control behavior in its vicinity—perhaps even at the glass transition.},

	abstract = {Model granular assemblies in which grains are assumed rigid and frictionless at equilibrium under some prescribed external load, are shown to possess, under generic conditions, several remarkable mechanical properties, related to isostaticity and potential energy minimization. Isostaticity—the uniqueness of the contact forces, once the list of contacts is known—is established in a quite general context, and the important distinction between isostatic problems under given external loads and isostatic (rigid) structures is presented. Complete rigidity is only guaranteed, on stability grounds, in the case of spherical cohesionless grains. Otherwise, the network of contacts might deform elastically in response to small load increments, even though grains are perfectly rigid. In general, one gets an upper bound on the contact coordination number. The approximation of small displacements that is introduced and discussed allows analogies to be drawn with other model systems studied in statistical mechanics, such as minimum paths on a lattice. It also entails the uniqueness of the equilibrium state (the list of contacts itself is geometrically determined) for cohesionless grains, and thus the absence of plastic dissipation in rearrangements of the network of contacts. Plasticity and hysteresis are related to the lack of such uniqueness, which can be traced back, apart from intergranular friction, to nonreversible rearrangements of small but finite extent, in which the system jumps between two distinct potential energy minima in configuration space, or to bounded tensile forces, deriving from a nonconvex potential, in the contacts. Properties of response functions to load increments are discussed. On the basis of past numerical studies, it is argued that, provided the approximation of small displacements is valid, displacements due to the rearrangements of the rigid grains in response to small load increments, once averaged on the macroscopic scale, are solutions to elliptic boundary value problems (similar to the Stokes problem for viscous incompressible flow).},

	abstract = {We present the results of a systematic numerical investigation of force distributions in granular packings. We find that all the main features of force transmission previously established for two-dimensional systems of hard particles hold in three-dimensional systems and for soft particles, too. In particular, the probability distribution of normal forces falls off exponentially for forces above the mean force. For forces below the mean, this distribution is either a decreasing power law when the system is far from static equilibrium, or nearly uniform at static equilibrium, in agreement with recent experiments. Moreover, we show that the forces below the mean do not contribute to the shear stress. The subnetwork of the contacts carrying a force below the mean thus plays a role similar to a fluid surrounding the solid backbone composed of the contacts carrying a force above the mean. We address the issue of the computation of contact forces in a packing at static equilibrium. We introduce a model with no local simplifying force rules, that allows for an exact computation of contact forces for given granular texture and boundary conditions. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {When a system jams, it undergoes a transition from a flowing to a rigid state. Despite this important change in the dynamics, the internal structure of the system remains disordered in the solid as well as the fluid phase. In this way jamming is quite different from crystallization, the other common way in which a fluid solidifies. Jamming is a paradigm for thinking about how many different types of fluids—from molecular liquids to macroscopic granular matter—develop rigidity. Here we review recent work on the jamming transition. We start with perhaps the simplest model: frictionless spheres interacting via repulsive finite-range forces at zero temperature. In this highly idealized case, the transition has aspects of both first- and second-order transitions. From studies of the normal modes of vibration for the marginally jammed solid, new physics has emerged for how a material can be rigid without having the elastic properties of a normal solid. We first survey the simulation data and theoretical arguments that have been proposed to understand this behavior. We then review work that has systematically gone beyond the ideal model to see whether the scenario developed there is more generally applicable. This includes work that examines the effect of nonspherical particles, friction, and temperature on the excitations and the dynamics. We briefly touch on recent laboratory experiments that have begun to make contact with simulations and theory.},

The rigid and flowing phases are strikingly different, yet measurements reveal that the structures of glass and liquid are virtually indistinguishable1, 2. It is therefore natural to ask whether there is a structural signature of the jammed granular state that distinguishes it from its flowing counterpart. Here we find evidence for such a signature, by measuring the contact-force distribution between particles during shearing. Because the forces are sensitive to minute variations in particle position, the distribution of forces can serve as a microscope with which to observe correlations in the positions of nearest neighbours. We find a qualitative change in the force distribution at the onset of jamming. If, as has been proposed3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, the jamming and glass transitions are related, our observation of a structural signature associated with jamming hints at the existence of a similar structural difference at the glass transition—presumably too subtle for conventional scattering techniques to uncover. Our measurements also provide a determination of a granular temperature that is the counterpart in granular systems to the glass-transition temperature in liquids.},

We present a novel partial-update near-neighbor list (NNL) algorithm that is superior to previous algorithms at high densities, without compromising the correctness of the algorithm. This efficiency of the algorithm is further increased for systems of very aspherical particles by using bounding sphere complexes (BSC). These techniques will be useful in any particle-based simulation, including Monte Carlo and time-driven molecular dynamics. Additionally, we allow for a non-vanishing rate of deformation of the boundary, which can be used to model macroscopic strain and also alleviate boundary effects for small systems. In the second part of this series of papers we specialize the algorithm to systems of ellipses and ellipsoids and present performance results for our implementation, demonstrating the practical utility of the algorithm.},

	abstract = {Understanding the characteristics of jammed particle packings provides basic insights into the structure and bulk properties of crystals, glasses, and granular media and into selected aspects of biological systems. This review describes the diversity of jammed configurations attainable by frictionless convex nonoverlapping (hard) particles in Euclidean spaces and for that purpose it stresses individual-packing geometric analysis. A fundamental feature of that diversity is the necessity to classify individual jammed configurations according to whether they are locally, collectively, or strictly jammed. Each of these categories contains a multitude of jammed configurations spanning a wide and (in the large system limit) continuous range of intensive properties, including packing fraction ϕ, mean contact number Z, and several scalar order metrics. Application of these analytical tools to spheres in three dimensions (an analog to the venerable Ising model) covers a myriad of jammed states, including maximally dense packings (as Kepler conjectured), low-density strictly jammed tunneled crystals, and a substantial family of amorphous packings. With respect to the last of these, the current approach displaces the historically prominent but ambiguous idea of “random close packing” with the precise concept of “maximally random jamming.” Both laboratory procedures and numerical simulation protocols can and, frequently, have been used for creation of ensembles of jammed states. But while the resulting distributions of intensive properties may individually approach narrow distributions in the large system limit, the distinguishing varieties of possible operational details in these procedures and protocols lead to substantial variability among the resulting distributions, some examples of which are presented here. This review also covers recent advances in understanding jammed packings of polydisperse sphere mixtures, as well as convex nonspherical particles, e.g., ellipsoids, “superballs,” and polyhedra. Because of their relevance to error-correcting codes and information theory, sphere packings in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces have been included as well. Some remarks are also made about packings in (curved) non-Euclidean spaces. In closing this review, several basic open questions for future research to consider have been identified.},

Using a radical Voronoï tessellation, we find the variance of the local volume fraction ϕ monotonically decreases as the system becomes more dense, independent of boundary condition and μ. We examine the universality and origins of this trend using experiments and the recent granocentric model [ M. Clusel, E. I. Corwin, A. O. N. Siemens and J. Brujić Nature (London) 460 611 (2009); E. I. Corwin, M. Clusel, A. O. N. Siemens and J. Brujić Soft Matter 6 2949 (2010)], modified to draw particle locations from an arbitrary distribution P(s) of neighbor distances s. The mean and variance of the observed P(s) are described by a single length scale controlled by ϕ̄. Through the granocentric model, we observe that diverse functional forms of P(s) all produce the trend of decreasing fluctuations, but only the experimentally observed P(s) provides quantitative agreement with the measured ϕ fluctuations. Thus, we find that both P(s) and P(ϕ) encode similar information about the ensemble of observed packings and are connected to each other by the local granocentric model.},

	abstract = {Recently the conventional notion of random close packing has been supplanted by the more appropriate concept of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) state. This inevitably leads to the necessity of distinguishing the MRJ state among the entire collection of jammed packings. While the ideal method of addressing this question would be to enumerate and classify all possible jammed hard-sphere configurations, practical limitations prevent such a method from being employed. Instead, we generate numerically a large number of representative jammed hard-sphere configurations (primarily relying on a slight modification of the Lubachevsky-Stillinger algorithm to do so) and evaluate several commonly employed order metrics for each of these packings. Our investigation shows that, even in the large-system limit, jammed systems of hard spheres can be generated with a wide range of packing fractions from φ≈0.52 to the fcc limit (φ≈0.74). Moreover, at a fixed packing fraction, the variation in the order can be substantial, indicating that the density alone does not uniquely characterize a packing. Interestingly, each order metric evaluated yielded a relatively consistent estimate for the packing fraction of the maximally random jammed state (φMRJ≈0.63). This estimate, however, is compromised by the weaknesses in the order metrics available, and we propose several guiding principles for future efforts to define more broadly applicable metrics.},

A simple theory involving statistics and geometry is presented by which the frequency distribution of these subunits can be calculated from the sphere size distribution and hence the structure of the packing can be determined. Results are presented for the porosities of binary and ternary sphere packings which bear a qualitative similarity to previously published experimental results. After defining the coordination numbers which are involved in multicomponent packings, results are presented for the contacts in such a packing.

One century ago, Minkowski obtained a rigorous lower bound on ϕmax that is controlled asymptotically by 1/2d, where d is the Euclidean space dimension. An indication of the difficulty of the problem can be garnered from the fact that exponential improvement of Minkowski’s bound has proved to be elusive, even though existing upper bounds suggest that such improvement should be possible. Using a statistical-mechanical procedure to optimize the density associated with a “test” pair correlation function and a conjecture concerning the existence of disordered sphere packings [
S. Torquato and F. H. Stillinger, Exp. Math. 15, 307 (2006)
], the putative exponential improvement on ϕmax was found with an asymptotic behavior controlled by 1/2(0.77865⋯)d. Using the same methods, we investigate whether this exponential improvement can be further improved by exploring other test pair correlation functions corresponding to disordered packings. We demonstrate that there are simpler test functions that lead to the same asymptotic result. More importantly, we show that there is a wide class of test functions that lead to precisely the same putative exponential improvement and therefore the asymptotic form 1/2(0.77865⋯)d is much more general than previously surmised. This class of test functions leads to an optimized average kissing number that is controlled by the same asymptotic behavior as the one found in the aforementioned paper.},

	abstract = {Packing problems are ubiquitous, ranging from oil extraction through porous rocks to grain storage in silos and the compaction of pharmaceutical powders into tablets. At a given density, particulate systems pack into a mechanically stable and amorphous jammed state. Previous theoretical studies have explored a connection between this jammed state and the glass transition, the thermodynamics of jamming and geometric modelling of random packings. Nevertheless, a simple underlying mechanism for the random assembly of athermal particles, analogous to crystalline ordering, remains unknown. Here we use three-dimensional measurements of packings of polydisperse emulsion droplets to build a simple statistical model in which the complexity of the global packing is distilled into a local stochastic process. From the perspective of a single particle, the packing problem is reduced to the random formation of nearest neighbours, followed by a choice of contacts among them. The two key parameters in the model—the available space around a particle and the ratio of contacts to neighbours—are directly obtained from experiments. We demonstrate that this 'granocentric' view captures the properties of the polydisperse emulsion packing—ranging from the microscopic distributions of nearest neighbours and contacts, to local density fluctuations, to the global packing density. Application of our results to monodisperse and bidisperse systems produces quantitative agreement with previously measured trends in global density. Our model therefore reveals a general principle of organization for random packing and may provide the foundations for a theory of jammed matter.},

A high precision electronic balance is used to measure normal forces on individual beads at the bottom of a granular material. Due to the high sensitivity of this setup the normal forces on individual beads without applying any external load on the system were measured. From these measurements the distribution of forces, the response to small perturbations at grain level and the spatial correlation between normal forces were investigated at the bottom of the packing. The distribution function is consistent with a power law with an exponent α=0.3 for small forces. At large forces a crossover to an exponential decay is observed with a decay constant β=1.8. Small amplitude spatial correlations were observed in the normal forces at the bottom of the pile, and the radial pressure distribution was dependent of the different filling procedures. Finally we report on systematic relaxations in the measured weight as a function of time on single grains at the bottom of the packing after perturbing the system.},

Packings of hard spheres are of even wider interest as they are related to important problems in information theory, such as digitalization of signals, error correcting codes, and optimization problems. In three dimensions the densest packing of identical hard spheres has been proven to be the fcc lattice, and it is conjectured that the closest packing is ordered (a regular lattice, e.g., a crystal) in low enough dimension. Still, amorphous packings have attracted much interest because for polydisperse colloids and granular materials the crystalline state is not obtained in experiments for kinetic reasons. A theory of amorphous packings, and more generally glassy states, of hard spheres is reviewed here, that is based on the replica method: this theory gives predictions on the structure and thermodynamics of these states. In dimensions between two and six these predictions can be successfully compared with numerical simulations. The limit of large dimension is also discussed where an exact solution is possible. Some of the results presented here were published, but others are original: in particular, an improved discussion of the large dimension limit and new results on the correlation function and the contact force distribution in three dimensions. The main assumptions that are beyond the theory presented are clarified and, in particular, the relation between static computation and the dynamical procedures used to construct amorphous packings. There remain many weak points in the theory that should be better investigated.},

Here, we show experimentally and with a new simulation algorithm that ellipsoids can randomly pack more densely—up to φ= 0.68 to 0.71for spheroids with an aspect ratio close to that of M\&M's Candies—and even approach φ ≈ 0.74 for ellipsoids with other aspect ratios. We suggest that the higher density is directly related to the higher number of degrees of freedom per particle and thus the larger number of particle contacts required to mechanically stabilize the packing. We measured the number of contacts per particle Z ≈ 10 for our spheroids, as compared to Z ≈ 6 for spheres.

To test this theory we performed extensive simulations for mixtures of elastic spheres with hydrodynamic friction. The simulations show a general (but weak) dependence of the final (essentially hard sphere) packing density on fluid viscosity and on particle size but this can be eliminated by choosing a specific relation between mass and particle size, making the random close packed volume fraction well defined.

	abstract = {We calculate the distribution of interparticle normal forces P(F) near the glass and jamming transitions in model supercooled liquids and foams, respectively. P(F) develops a peak that appears near the glass or jamming transitions, whose height increases with decreasing temperature, decreasing shear stress and increasing packing density. A similar shape of P(F) was observed in experiments on static granular packings. We propose that the appearance of this peak signals the development of a yield stress. The sensitivity of the peak to temperature, shear stress, and density lends credence to the recently proposed generalized jamming phase diagram.},

The response to local forcing is non-self-averaging and fluctuates over a length scale that diverges at the jamming transition. The response to global forcing becomes increasingly nonaffine near the jamming transition. This is due to the proximity of floppy modes, the influence of which we characterize by the local linear response. We show that the local response also governs the anomalous scaling of elastic constants and contact number.},

Here we review the current understanding of the transition to jamming and the nature of the jammed state for disordered packings of particles that act through repulsive contact interactions and are at zero temperature and zero shear stress. We first discuss the breakdown of affine assumptions that underlies the rich mechanics near jamming. We then extensively discuss jamming of frictionless soft spheres. At the jamming point, these systems are marginally stable (isostatic) in the sense of constraint counting, and many geometric and mechanical properties scale with distance to this jamming point. Finally, we discuss current explorations of jamming of frictional and non-spherical (ellipsoidal) particles. Both friction and asphericity tune the contact number at jamming away from the isostatic limit, but in opposite directions. This allows one to disentangle the distance to jamming and the distance to isostaticity. The picture that emerges is that most quantities are governed by the contact number and scale with the distance to isostaticity, while the contact number itself scales with the distance to jamming.},

	abstract = {We have studied the contact network properties of two and three dimensional polydisperse, frictionless sphere packings at the random closed packing density through simulations. We observe universal correlations between particle size and contact number that are independent of the polydispersity of the packing. This allows us to formulate a mean field version of the granocentric model to predict the contact number distribution P(z). We find the predictions to be in good agreement with a wide range of discrete and continuous size distributions. The values of the two parameters that appear in the model are also independent of the polydispersity of the packing. Finally we look at the nearest neighbour spatial correlations to investigate the validity of the granocentric approach. We find that both particle size and contact number are anti-correlated which contrasts with the assumptions of the granocentric model. Despite this shortcoming, the correlations are sufficiently weak which explains the good approximation of P(z) obtained from the model.},

This expression agrees with the leading term in V/V 0—1 of the usual free‐volume approximation for N = ∞. The conditions under which this conclusion is established are a restriction to a finite number of molecules N with periodic boundary conditions, and the requirement that as V→V 0 the accessible configuration states approach a close‐packed configuration whose coordination number c satisfies the requirement c≥2ν−2(ν−1)/N. Such a limiting configuration, from which only an infinitesimal region of configuration space is accessible under an infinitesimal expansion, is called a stable configuration; the above restriction on the coordination number is a necessary condition for stability. The difficulties which appear as N→∞ are indicated.},

The measurements were made at the vapor pressure spanning the region from 22 mK below the superfluid transition to 4μK above. The experiment was performed in Earth orbit to reduce the rounding of the transition caused by gravitationally induced pressure gradients on Earth. Specific-heat measurements were made deep in the asymptotic region to within 2 nK of the transition. No evidence of rounding was found to this resolution. The optimum value of the critical exponent describing the specific-heat singularity was found to be α=-0.0127±0.0003. This is bracketed by two recent estimates based on renormalization-group techniques, but is slightly outside the range of the error of the most recent result. The ratio of the coefficients of the leading-order singularity on the two sides of the transition is A+/A-=1.053±0.002, which agrees well with a recent estimate. By combining the specific-heat and superfluid density exponents a test of the Josephson scaling relation can be made. Excellent agreement is found based on high-precision measurements of the superfluid density made elsewhere. These results represent the most precise tests of theoretical predictions for critical phenomena to date.},

For packings of frictionless spheres near the jamming transition, these advances predict that nontrivial power-law exponents characterize the critical distribution of (i) small interparticle gaps and (ii) weak contact forces, both of which are crucial for mechanical stability. The scaling of the interparticle gaps is known to be constant in all spatial dimensions d—including the physically relevant d=2 and 3, but the value of the weak force exponent remains the object of debate and confusion. Here, we resolve this ambiguity by numerical simulations. We construct isostatic jammed packings with extremely high accuracy, and introduce a simple criterion to separate the contribution of particles that give rise to localized buckling excitations, i.e., bucklers, from the others. This analysis reveals the remarkable dimensional robustness of mean-field marginality and its associated criticality.},

	abstract = {A broad class of disordered materials including foams, glassy molecular systems, colloids and granular materials can form jammed states. A jammed system can resist small stresses without deforming irreversibly, whereas unjammed systems flow under any applied stresses. The broad applicability of the Liu–Nagel jamming concept has attracted intensive theoretical and modelling interest but has prompted less experimental effort. In the Liu–Nagel framework, jammed states of athermal systems exist only above a certain critical density. Although numerical simulations for particles that do not experience friction broadly support this idea, the nature of the jamming transition for frictional grains is less clear. Here we show that jamming of frictional, disk-shaped grains can be induced by the application of shear stress at densities lower than the critical value, at which isotropic (shear-free) jamming occurs. These jammed states have a much richer phenomenology than the isotropic jammed states: for small applied shear stresses, the states are fragile, with a strong force network that percolates only in one direction. A minimum shear stress is needed to create robust, shear-jammed states with a strong force network percolating in all directions. The transitions from unjammed to fragile states and from fragile to shear-jammed states are controlled by the fraction of force-bearing grains. The fractions at which these transitions occur are statistically independent of the density. Jammed states with densities lower than the critical value have an anisotropic fabric (contact network). The minimum anisotropy of shear-jammed states vanishes as the density approaches the critical value from below, in a manner reminiscent of an order–disorder transition.},

This sluggishness is often ascribed to the free energy landscape containing multiple minima (basins) separated by high barriers. Here we show, using theory and numerical simulation, that the landscape is much rougher than is classically assumed. Deep in the glass, it undergoes a ‘roughness transition’ to fractal basins, which brings about isostaticity and marginal stability on approaching jamming. Critical exponents for the basin width, the weak force distribution and the spatial spread of quasi-contacts near jamming can be analytically determined. Their value is found to be compatible with numerical observations. This advance incorporates the jamming transition of granular materials into the framework of glass theory. Because temperature and pressure control what features of the landscape are experienced, glass mechanics and transport are expected to reflect the features of the topology we discuss here.},

The main theoretical approaches are presented describing the glass transition in supercooled liquids, focusing on theories that have a microscopic, statistical mechanics basis.

	abstract = {When we lower the temperature of a liquid, at some point we meet a first order phase transition to the crystal. Yet, under certain conditions it is possible to keep the system in its metastable phase and to avoid crystallization. In this way the liquid enters in the supercooled phase. Supercooled liquids have a very rich phenomenology, which is still far from being completely understood. To begin with, there is the problem of how to prevent crystallization and how deeply the liquid can be supercooled before a metastability limit is hit. But by far the most interesting feature of supercooled liquids is the dynamic glass transition: when the temperature is decreased below a certain point, the relaxation time increases so much that a dramatic dynamical arrest intervenes and we are unable to equilibrate the system within reasonable experimental times. The glass transition is a phenomenon whose physical origin has stirred an enormous interest in the last hundred years. Why does it occur? Is it just a conventional reference point, or does it have a more profound physical meaning? Is it a purely dynamical event, or the manifestation of a true thermodynamic transition? What is the correlation length associated to the sharp increase of the relaxation time? Can we define a new kind of amorphous order? A shared theory of supercooled liquids and the glass transition does not yet exist and these questions are still largely open. Here, I will illustrate in the most elementary fashion the main phenomenological traits of supercooled liquids and discuss in a very partial way a few theoretical ideas on the subject.},

However, the task of determining whether or not an image of an experimental system is hyperuniform is experimentally challenging due to finite-resolution, noise, and sample-size effects that influence characterization measurements. Here we explore these issues, employing video optical microscopy to study hyperuniformity phenomena in disordered two-dimensional jammed packings of soft spheres. Using a combination of experiment and simulation we characterize the possible adverse effects of particle polydispersity, image noise, and finite-size effects on the assignment of hyperuniformity, and we develop a methodology that permits improved diagnosis of hyperuniformity from real-space measurements. The key to this improvement is a simple packing reconstruction algorithm that incorporates particle polydispersity to minimize the free volume. In addition, simulations show that hyperuniformity in finite-sized samples can be ascertained more accurately in direct space than in reciprocal space. Finally, our experimental colloidal packings of soft polymeric spheres are shown to be effectively hyperuniform.},

	abstract = {Cell motion inside dense tissues governs many biological processes, including embryonic development and cancer metastasis, and recent experiments suggest that these tissues exhibit collective glassy behavior. To make quantitative predictions about glass transitions in tissues, we study a self-propelled Voronoi (SPV) model that simultaneously captures polarized cell motility and multi-body cell-cell interactions in a confluent tissue, where there are no gaps between cells. We demonstrate that the model exhibits a jamming transition from a solid-like state to a fluid-like state that is controlled by three parameters: the single-cell motile speed, the persistence time of single-cell tracks, and a target shape index that characterizes the competition between cell-cell adhesion and cortical tension. In contrast to traditional particulate glasses, we are able to identify an experimentally accessible structural order parameter that specifies the entire jamming surface as a function of model parameters. We demonstrate that a continuum Soft Glassy Rheology model precisely captures this transition in the limit of small persistence times, and explain how it fails in the limit of large persistence times. These results provide a framework for understanding the collective solid-to-liquid transitions that have been observed in embryonic development and cancer progression, which may be associated with Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition in these tissues.},

	abstract = {While frictionless spheres at jamming are isostatic, frictional spheres at jamming are not. As a result, frictional spheres near jamming do not necessarily exhibit an excess of soft modes. However, a generalized form of isostaticity can be introduced if fully mobilized contacts at the Coulomb friction threshold are considered as slipping contacts. We show here that, in this framework, the vibrational density of states (DOS) of frictional discs exhibits a plateau when the generalized isostaticity line is approached. The crossover frequency ω * scales linearly with the distance from this line. Moreover, we show that the frictionless limit, which appears singular when fully mobilized contacts are treated elastically, becomes smooth when fully mobilized contacts are allowed to slip. Finally, we elucidate the nature of the vibrational modes, both for slipping and for non-slipping fully mobilized contacts.},

	abstract = {Amorphous packings of frictionless, spherical particles are isostatic at jamming onset, with the number of constraints (contacts) equal to the number of degrees of freedom. Their structural and mechanical properties are controlled by the interparticle contact network. In contrast, amorphous packings of frictional particles are typically hyperstatic at jamming onset. We perform extensive numerical simulations in two dimensions of the geometrical asperity (GA) model for static friction to further investigate the role of isostaticity. In the GA model, interparticle forces are obtained by summing up purely repulsive central forces between periodically spaced circular asperities on contacting grains. We compare the packing fraction, contact number, mobilization distribution, and vibrational density of states (in the harmonic approximation) using the GA model to those generated using the Cundall-Strack approach. We find that static packings of frictional disks obtained from the GA model are mechanically stable and isostatic when we consider interactions between asperities on contacting particles. The crossover in the structural and mechanical properties of static packings from frictionless to frictional behavior as a function of the static friction coefficient coincides with a change in the type of interparticle contacts and the disappearance of a peak in the density of vibrational modes for the GA model. These results emphasize that mesoscale features of the model for static friction play an important role in determining the properties of granular packings.},
