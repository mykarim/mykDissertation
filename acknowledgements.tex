\acknowledge{All of this work has been done with the guidance of my advisor Eric Corwin, who has shaped me into the scientist that I now am. For various insights on my simulations and analysis in addition to creating a cohesive lab, I would like to thank my labmates: Yasin Karim, Alex Trevelyan, Kyle Welch, and Andy Hammond, as well as Ben Strickland who worked loosely on this project for a summer and our undergraduate researcher Mike van der Naald. I would like to thank John Royer at the National Institute for Standards and Technology for proof-reading all of the papers that are included in this work. I would also like to thank my committee for their advice at various points throughout my graduate career. Of these especially, I would like to thank Richard Taylor, whose lab I joined early on. His unique approach to problems and his focus on novel geometry continues to inspire me. Last, and most importantly, the writing and compiling of this work was done while I was recovering from a severe concussion, and so I would like to thank my parents, my doctors, Roger Smith, and Yasin Karim for providing emotional and physical support. This work would have not been possible by any stretch of the imagination without them.}
